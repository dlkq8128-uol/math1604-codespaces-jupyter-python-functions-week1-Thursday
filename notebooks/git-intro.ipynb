You will learn how to create a repository, make changes, commit them, create branches, and merge your changes back into the main project. By the end of this worksheet, you will have a basic understanding of how GitHub helps you collaborate on data science projects in a cloud-based development environment."

    "- **Version control**: Tracking changes to your code and data files.\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Easily working with others, reviewing changes, and discussing ideas.\n",
    "- **Continuous integration and deployment**: Automating tasks such as testing and building.\n",
